We'd love to accept your patches and contributions to the project. If you wish to contribute, please read this first. 

This project welcomes non-code contributions, too! The following types of contributions are welcome:

- **Ideas**: participate in an issue thread or start your own to have your voice heard.

- **Copy editing**: fix typos, clarify language, and improve the quality of the documentation.
- **Formatting**: help keep docs easy to read with consistent formatting.
- **Trranslating**: help tranlating the app UI, documentation or website.

Apply relevent labels as `bug`, and the platform: `platform:win`, `platform:darwin`, `platform:linux`, `platform:all`.

### Translations

Are interested in writing code for this project? Awesome! 

We use following technolgies and tools,

As of now we have no direct communcation forum such as IRC Channel or Slack. We are hope to setup something soon. Menawhile we use the Github issue tracker for all communications.

### Developing features and fixing bugs

Please search issues and pull requests before adding something new to avoid duplicating efforts and conversations. Please create an issue (if not one already created) when you start working on a feature/bug. Also, put a comment that mentioning you are working on that to avoid duplicate efforts.

Please don't create any new labels. If you think it;s nice to have or must have a new label, please create a new issue or put it in the comments on a relevent thread. That'll help us to keep clean and efficient workflow.
