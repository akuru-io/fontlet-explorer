# Contributing to Fontlet project

Fontlet is a free software project hosted on Github, and runs the [typical](http://producingoss.com) free software way.
We'd love to accept your patches and contributions to the project. If you wish to contribute, please read this first.

We use following technolgies/tools mainly,

- NodeJs
- Electron with React.js (CRA)
- styled-components
- blueprintjs
- ESLint/ Prettier

Please don't create any new labels. If you think it;s nice to have or must have a new label, please create a new issue or put it in the comments on a relevent thread. That'll help us to keep clean and efficient workflow.

## How to Contribute

There are few ways contribute to the project.

- Reporting bugs and issues you encouter when you using the app.
- Sending feature requests, improvement ideas and suggestions.
- Developing a feature or fixing a bug.
- Translating the app
- Help with documentation and promotions.

As of now we have no direct communcation forum such as IRC Channel or Slack. We are hope to setup something soon. Menawhile you can use the Github issue tracker to communicate with the developers.

### Reporting bugs

Create an issue with clear description, steps to reproduce, screenshots and other necessory information that might help developers to reporduce the problem and fix it.

Apply relevent labels as `bug`, and the platform: `platform:win`, `platform:darwin`, `platform:linux`, `platform:all`.

### Sending feature requests

Create an issue with clear description.
If it's a feature requests use `feature` tag as the albel. If it's just about an improvement suggestion of existing feature, use `enhancement`. If it's related to UX/UI you can use `ui/ux` label as well.

### Developing features/ fixing bugs

Please create an issue (if not one already created) when you start working on a feature/bug. Also, put a comment that mentioning you are working on that to avoid duplicate efforts.

### Translating

We do not have internationalisation in place yet.

### Documentaion

Update documentation and send PRs. :)
